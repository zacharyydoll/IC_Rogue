CONCEPTION

- Cherry that increases fire-rate and health points.
- Boss that moves randomly and shoots fireballs in random directions (inspired from the work of previous projects).
- Staff and Bow sprite for the player.
- Change of sprites (of weapons) when pressing S, or switches automatically when the player has no more arrows
- Added 2 new Rooms
- Added 1 Character (King.java, which extends the added class Ally.java, needed for future implementation of other allies)
- Added code to be able to differentiate arrows and fireballs shot by the player, with those shot by enemies, needed to prevent the player from harming himself
